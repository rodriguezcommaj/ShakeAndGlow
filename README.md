Shake and Glow
==============

### For Shaking and Glowing

Shake and Glow is a super simple little experiment to mess around with the CSS3 text-shadow, transition, and keyframe animations properties. It doesn't really have much utility right now, I just wanted to see how some of this stuff worked. Only test in the most recent versions of Firefox and Chrome, and I didn't even bother with all of the vendor prefixes, so your mileage may vary (greatly).
